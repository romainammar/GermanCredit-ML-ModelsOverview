# German Credit Dataset - Machine Learning Models Overview

## Context
A loan application form seeks a lot of information about the applicant. Such data can be used to build a classifiers to make predictions about which customers are most likely to turn up as fraudulent. The customers who have been predicted to have a high probability to default are the declined to loan. 

The goal of this lab is to use historical data to build a model that could help the bank officer to decide whether or not to approve a loan request based on the information submitted by the applicant such as credit history, loan purpose, account status, employment, the loan amount, purpose of the loan, gender and marital status of the requester, etc. 

From the data science point of view the aim is to evaluate various modeling techniques, calibrate their parameters as well as understand the tradeoff between the different approaches such as data and model assumptions implied by each case. In order to be able to compare the different models it is necessary to establish a figure of merit that is relevant to the business challenge.

This notebook is organized as follows:

- Data gathering
- Exploratory data analysis
- Preparing the data
- Model running
- Model evaluation
